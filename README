Hello, this is my portfolio project using Playwright to automate QA testing for a variety of sites.

This project demonstrates the capabilities of Playwright in performing end-to-end testing, including:
- Cross-browser testing
- Responsive design testing
- Performance testing

I will use one of my own websites I created for this project, using a simple HTML/CSS/JS stack, hosted on GitHub Pages.
